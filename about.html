                <h1>Welcome to My Shop!</h1>
                <p>
                    I'm Aaron AKA RamuneBear. A lot of people just call me bear.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm a small business focused on creating 
                    cute and funky designs.
                </p>
                <p>I enjoy creating vector artwork, along with crayon-looking illustrations. My illustration colors mostly consist of 
                    <span style="color:#ef4842;">red</span>, 
                    <span style="color:#8dca81;">green</span>, 
                    <span style="color:#529af3;">blue</span>, and 
                    <span style="color:#ffd12c;">yellow</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my shop, some items are cute doodles, others may be 
                    artwork that I made with the intention to convey certain 
                    emotions. From soft apparel and accessories to
                    cute collectibles, I'm focused on creating designs 
                    that reflect my brand and myself.
                </p>
